<h1><img src=../aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93>&nbsp; Network settings: Options</h1>

<h2><a name=imgload>Image loading</a></h2>
This chooser lets you select if you want AWeb to load images:
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>All images
   <td>AWeb will start loading every image as soon as it is encountered
   in a page. This could consume a lot of bandwidth, especially if you are
   using a slow connection.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>Maps only
   <td>This option doesn't load all images, but only clickable maps. This
   can save a lot of traffic, and still lets you use clickable maps, as these
   are often essential navigation tools.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Off
   <td>AWeb will never load images automatically. If you want to see an image,
   you have to click on its icon.
</table>

<h2><a name=localindex>Local index</a></h2>
If the name of a local file requested ends in a slash (/), this name is
appended to the file name. This allows setting up your own WWW pages
locally without having to change the names.

<h2><a name=maxconn>Max. network connections</a></h2>
AWeb is capable of handling an unlimited number of parallel network
connections. You might want to limit this number to a reasonable maximum,
to avoid overloading your network line.
<p>
The status of all connections can be viewed in the
<a href=../nws.html>network status window</a>.

<h2><a name=maxdisk>Max. disk reads</a></h2>
Although you may have set the number of network connections to a reasonable
maximum, it could cause disk trashing when you try to load local files.<br>
<font size=-1>Disk trashing is the phenomena you may encounter when two
or more files from the same device are read simultaneously. Most of the
time the disk is busy moving its read heads to and fro, causing the speed
of data transfer to drop dramatically.</font>
<p>
To avoid this, you can limit the number of local disk reads independently.

<h2><a name=home>Home page</a></h2>
This is the URL of your <em>home page</em> as far as AWeb is concerned.
It doesn't need to be the same as your home page on the WWW. It is merely
the page that will be shown if you select
<code>Navigate / Home&nbsp;document</code> from the menu, or click the
<em>home</em> button.

<h2><a name=autosearchurl>Autosearch URL</a></h2>
Enter the URL of the search engine you want to use for
<a href="../autosearch.html">autosearch</a> here. You should use the form
of the URL sent by the search entry form. Use <b><code>%s</code></b>
as a placeholder for the search argument.

<h2>Start with homepage</h2>
If this checkbox is checked, AWeb will retrieve the page defined as your
<a href=#home>home page</a> immediately when you start the program. If
this option is not checked, you will initially get an empty window.

<h2><a name=ignoremime>Ignore server MIME type</a></h2>
As explained in the <a href=brviewers.html>external
viewers</a> section, most servers send the MIME type along with the data.
Unfortunately, some servers send the wrong MIME type if they fail to
recognize the true type of the data. This may lead to a file being saved
instead of passed to an external viewer as expected.
<p>
In those cases, it is best to ignore the MIME type as reported by the
server, and let AWeb identify the MIME type by the file name extension.
<p>
If this checkbox is selected, the MIME type as reported by the server
is ignored.

<h2><a name=autosearch>Enable autosearch</a></h2>
If you check this checkbox, <a href="../autosearch.html">autosearch</a>
is enabled.

<h2><a name=contanim>Continuous animation</a></h2>
Controls the way the <a href="../gui.html#backstat">background status</a>
indicator (or transfer animation) works. By default, this indicator is moved
one step ahead at each bit of network activity. If you enable continuous
animation, the animation plays at constant speed as long as transfers are
going on.

<h2><a name=restrictimages>Restrict images to same host</a></h2>
If you check this checkbox, images that originate from a different host than
the document in which they appear, will not be loaded automatically. Use this
to prevent many banners to be loaded and displayed.
<p>
With this option unchecked, all images will be loaded automatically regardless
of their origin (provided the <a href="#imgload">Image loading</a> setting
allow image loading in the first place).

<h2><a name=spoofas>Spoof as</a></h2>
This field enables you to change the browser ID that is used to identify the
browser with the server. Some servers use this information to return different
versions of a document. The drop down list contains a few suggested IDs, but
you can type any ID you like.
<p>
Leave the field empty (choose "(AWeb)" from the drop down list) to use
the original AWeb ID.
