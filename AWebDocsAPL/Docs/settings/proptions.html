<h2>Save path</h2>
AWeb will always ask where to save a downloaded file, or the HTML source
when using the <code>Project / Save&nbsp;As...</code> menu function. The
default save path will be the initial drawer used in the save file
requester.

<h2><a name=tempdir>Temp path</a></h2>
This is the path used for temporary files. These include files passed to
<a href=brviewers.html>external viewers</a>, and images that are
<a href=../cache.html#nocache>not cached</a>.

<h2>Scroll overlap</h2>
If you scroll up or down by a page, there is some overlap. Because you 
might want to have a larger overlapping area when you are using a larger
font, you can change the overlap size.
<p>
Set this gadget to the desired overlap size, measured in pixels.

<h2><a name=shellcmd>Allow Shell commands in links</a></h2>
AWeb offers a powerful facility to execute <a href=../shellcmd.html>Shell
commands</a> just by clicking a hyperlink or submitting a form.
<p>
Although this feature can be very useful, it could also cause severe damage if
an undesired command like FORMAT would be executed. Therefore this feature
is disabled by default. Select this checkbox to enable it.

<h2><a name=hlclose>Hotlist requester auto close</a></h2>
If this checkbox is selected, the
<a href=../hotlist.html#viewer>hotlist viewer window</a> will
close automatically if you follow a link in that window.
If this checkbox is not selected, the window remains open until you close
it yourself.

<h2><a name=hlrequester>Hotlist button gives requester</a></h2>
If this checkbox is selected, the <em>hotlist</em>
button will open the <a href=../hotlist.html#viewer>hotlist viewer
window</a>. Otherwise, the hotlist is displayed in the browser window.

<h2><a name=hwclose>History window auto close</a></h2>
If this checkbox is selected, the <a href="../winhis.html">history window</a>
will close automatically if you pick a document from the window to display.
If this checkbox is not selected, the window remains open until you close
it yourself.

<h2><a name=dragging>Allow dragging</a></h2>
If this checkbox is selected, <a href="../browser.html#clipboard">clipboard
drag-selecting</a> is enabled by default.

<h2><a name=icons>Create icons</a></h2>
If this checkbox is checked, AWeb will create an icon for each file that
was saved or downloaded. If it is a text file (HTML or plain text), it
sets AWeb as the default tool so you can easily view the text with a
doubleclick on the icon.

<h2><a name=autoopen>Auto open</a></h2>
These checkboxes determine if the
<a href=../hotlist.html#viewer>hotlist viewer window</a>,
the <a href=../winhis.html>history window</a> and the
<a href=../nws.html>network status window</a> should automatically be opened
when you start AWeb.
<p>
You can use the <code>Settings / Snapshot&nbsp;windows</code> menu item
to save the positions where these windows should open.

<h2><a name=centerreqs>Center requesters</a></h2>
Use this checkbox to determine if requesters (error requesters, confirmation
requesters, etc.) open in the center of the screen, or in the top left corner.
