Using the chooser, you can make AWeb to open on the default public screen,
a named public screen, or let AWeb open its own public screen.

<h2><a name=defpubscr>Default public screen</a></h2>
If this is selected, AWeb will open its windows on the default public
screen. Usually this is the Workbench screen.

<h2>Named public screen</h2>
AWeb will open its windows on a public screen that is not necessarily
the default. You can enter the screen name you want AWeb to open on.
<p>
If the screen doesn't exist when AWeb starts, the default public screen
is used instead.

<h2>Own public screen</h2>
Using this selection, AWeb will open its own public screen. The name of
this screen is <b>AWeb</b>.
<p>
Clicking the <u><img src=../popscreen.iff alt=O width=19 height=21></u> button will pop up
a standard screen mode requester. Here you can select a screen mode,
width, height and number of colours.

<h3>Load spread palette</h3>
AWeb is able to pre-load a palette if it opens its own screen. This
palette contains an even spread of colours (or shades of gray), that will be used by all
images. Using this feature avoids distortion of the palette that happens
if one image takes up all colours, leaving no reasonable colours for
next images.
<p>
With this <em>chooser</em> gadget, you have the choice of loading a colour palette,
a grayscale palette, or no palette loading.
<p>
AWeb will never load such a palette for screens with more than 256 colours.
Those screens will be on a graphics card that is assumed to accommodate
"enough" colours for all possible images.
<p>
Please be aware that 256 colours (or less) is not many. Although AWeb tries
to calculate an evenly spread palette, still many images will not look
optimal. If you don't load the palette, the first few images look great,
but later images may look even worse. A grayscale will give more acceptable
results when there are little colours available.
<p>
If you select a grayscale palette, you will probably want to configure your
JPEG (JFIF) datatype to use a grayscale mapping for the "AWebIP" task. Otherwise
JPEG images might not be displayed.
