<h1><img src=../aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93>&nbsp; Browser settings: Viewers</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
For objects that cannot be displayed directly in the browser window, AWeb starts
an external program, called a <em>viewer</em>. In spite of the name
"viewer", this is not limited to graphical files. The external viewer
for an audio file, for example, will play the audio file.
For other objects, you may want to make use of an external <em>plugin
module</em>, either because AWeb doesn't handle the object internally, or
the plugin module offers more features. Finally, you may know that you
always want to save certain type of objects to disk (Lha archives, for example).
<p>
The type of the object, and thereby the particular action to take, is
determined by the <a href=../mime.html>MIME type</a> of the object.
<p>
For each MIME type you want to be recognized by AWeb, there should be an entry
on this page with the appropriate action and viewer or plugin module name
defined.

<h2>Changing MIME types</h2>
Select the MIME type you want to modify from the listview.
Use the <b>Add</b> button to add a new blank row. Use the <b>Del</b> button
to remove the selected row. Note that the TEXT/HTML and TEXT/PLAIN types
cannot be removed.

<h2>MIME type and subtype</h2>
In these string gadgets, you specify the MIME type and subtype.
See the <a href=../mime.html>About MIME types</a> chapter for more
information on MIME types.
<p>
You can use an asterisk to specify a wildcard subtype. AWeb will use
the external viewer defined in this row for files with the same type but
a subtype for which no external viewer is defined. See the
<a href=#example>example</a>.

<h2>Extensions</h2>
Most servers send the MIME type together with the data. AWeb will then use
this MIME type, unless <a href=nwoptions.html#ignoremime>Ignore
server MIME type</a> is selected.
If the server doesn't specify the MIME type (or if it is ignored), AWeb tries to
determine the MIME type from the file name extension. If that fails, AWeb
looks at the data to see if it is HTML text or plain text.
<p>
The extensions are especially important when looking at local files. As
there is no server for local files, there is only the extension that tells
AWeb about the type of the file.
<p>
In this string gadget, you type the extensions that could identify this
MIME type. Separate multiple extensions by spaces or commas. The extensions
are not case sensitive.

<h2>Action</h2>
Use this chooser to select the action to perform for the MIME type.
<table>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Default
   <td valign=top>Specifying <em>default</em> for a "TYPE/SUBTYPE" entry
      means: use the action specified for "TYPE/*". For "TYPE/*" entries,
      <em>default</em> is the same as <em>internal</em>.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Internal
   <td valign=top>For TEXT/HTML, TEXT/PLAIN, IMAGE/* and AUDIO/* types,
      AWeb has built-in drivers. The image and audio drivers are based
      on datatypes, and therefore somewhat limited in their features.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>AWeb Plugin
   <td valign=top>AWeb supports the use of external <em>plugin modules</em>.
      Plugin modules act as a replacement or addition to
      the internal drivers.<p>
      Use the <em>Name</em> field to select the name of the plugin module
      to be used. Use the <em>Arguments</em> field to specify any
      additional arguments that the plugin module may need. Refer to the documentation
      of the plugin module for the arguments allowed.
      <p>
      <b>NOTE:</b> These plugin modules should not be confused with external
      ARexx scripts, sometimes also called "plugins".
<tr><th align=left valign=top>External program
   <td valign=top>An external program will be started for this file.<p>
      Use the <a href=cmdargs.html>Command and Arguments</a> fields
      to specify the viewer command to execute for this MIME type.
      Argument parameters are:
      <table>
      <tr valign=top>
         <th align=left valign=top>%f
         <td>file name to "view"
      <tr valign=top>
         <th align=left valign=top>%n
         <td>screen name that AWeb is running on, in case your
         external viewer supports opening on a public screen. Use this only if you
         want it to open on the same screen as AWeb.
      <tr valign=top>
         <th align=left valign=top>%u
         <td>original URL of this object.
      <tr valign=top>
         <th align=left valign=top>%m
         <td>the MIME type of the object.
      </table>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>External program with PIPE
   <td valign=top>As with <em>External program</em>, an external program
      is started. The difference is that using a PIPE the program is started
      as soon as data for the file arrives, and the data is sent to the
      program through a PIPE: file. This speeds up the process, because
      you don't have to wait until all data has arrived before the program
      is started.<br>
      Note that datatype based programs do not work with PIPEs.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Save to disk
   <td valign=top>The file is not processed, but always saved to disk instead.
</table>

<p>
If AWeb can't determine the MIME type, or if the MIME type is known but
not in the list, or if the MIME type is in the list but there is no valid action
defined, AWeb will pop up a save requester. You can than
save the file, and try to process it later.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b> that these MIME settings are used for <em>every</em> file. Especially
embedded images in a HTML document will be shown by an external viewer if you
define one for images. To display the images in the HTML document itself,
set the action to internal, or configure an appropriate plugin module. You can
define a separate <a href="prprograms.html">image viewer</a> to be used for
standalone images.

<h2><a name=example>Example</a></h2>
Suppose you want to play MIDI audio files using the GMPlay program, and
other audio files using the (hypothetical) PowerEars program that can take a
PIPE (streaming input). It should open its
window on the same screen as AWeb. Since you have a WAV datatype,
WAV sounds should be played by AWeb internally.
<p>
Then you would configure the following MIME types:
<dl>
<dt><table border width=100%><tr><td width=20%>AUDIO/BASIC<td width=20% nowrap>au<td width=1%>D<td width=59%></table>
<dd>This row specifies that AU files can be recognized by their .au extension.
You specify the default action (D) because you want to use the default
player, defined in the AUDIO/* row.
<p>
<dt><table border width=100%><tr><td width=20%>AUDIO/MIDI<td width=20% nowrap>midi mid<td width=1%>E<td width=59%>GMPlay:GMPlay %f</table>
<dd>This row defines the possible extensions .midi and .mid for MIDI files.
It also specifies that MIDI files should be played using the external (E) GMPlay program.
<p>
<dt><table border width=100%><tr><td width=20%>AUDIO/WAV<td width=20% nowrap>wav<td width=1%>I<td width=59%></table>
<dd>This row specifies that WAV files can be recognized by their .wav extension,
and that they should be played by AWeb internally (I).
<p>
<dt><table border width=100%><tr><td width=20%>AUDIO/X-8SVX<td width=20% nowrap>8svx svx<td width=1%>D<td width=59%></table>
<dd>This row defines an extension MIME type for 8SVX files. Note that the
subtype starts with <b>X-</b> because it is not an official MIME type.
This line is important when accessing at 8SVX files on your local computer,
as AWeb has no way to identify them as 8SVX files other than the extensions
given here.
<p>
<dt><table border width=100%><tr><td width=20%>AUDIO/*<td width=20% nowrap><td width=1%>P<td width=59%>PE:PowerEars %f PUBSCREEN %n</table>
<dd>This row defines what player (the hypothetical Powerears program) to use
for all other audio files but MIDI and WAV. Even files with different subtypes
than BASIC (but main type AUDIO) will be played using this player.<br>
There are no extensions defined here, because all extensions are given in
the different subtype rows. As an alternative, you could remove the
AUDIO/BASIC and AUDIO/X-8SVX rows, and specify all extensions (au 8svx svx)
here.
