<h2>Change the default colours</h2>
To change the colour of a link, text or background, select the appropriate row in the list.
There are different colour settings for:
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>New link
   <td>This colour is used for links to pages that you haven't visited yet.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Visited link
   <td>Links to pages you have visited before are shown in this colour.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Selected link
   <td>This is the highlight colour a link will have when you click it.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Background
   <td>The background colour of a page without a background colour or
   background image.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>Text
   <td>The default colour of normal text on a page.
</table>
<p>
Then press the <b>Change colour</b> button, this will pop up a colour
requester. Note that this colour requester (as opposed to the
<a href=prpalette.html>Program Palette</a> colour requester) does <em>not</em>
change the screen's palette. Instead, it picks the colour from the available
palette that fits best to the selected colour values. Internally, the 24
bit colour values are stored, and for every screen that AWeb opens on, the best
fitting colours are determined.
<p>
These settings are ignored if a page defines its own colours.

<h2>Use screen text and background colours</h2>
Suppose you don't want any special colour for your background and text, but
just the normal screen colours. Instead of trying to get the palette exactly
right to match the screen colours, you can simply select this checkbox. Then
the palette settings for browser background and text are ignored, and those
of the screen are used (unless the page defines its own colours).
