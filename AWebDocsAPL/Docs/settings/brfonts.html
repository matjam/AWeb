<h2>Introduction</h2>
On this page you can configure what fonts to use for normal text (usually
a proportional font) and text that should be rendered in a fixed-width typeface. 
<p>
In addition to these two standard fonts, many pages on the web explicitly uses
other fonts. Unfortunately the names used for these fonts are usually not found
on the Amiga, but only on the PC (like "Arial"). Therefore you can add your own
font names (called <i>aliases</i>) and define wich Amiga font is to be used for
these font names.

<h2>Font type</h2>
In this list you can select one of the two standard fonts or one of the
additionally defined aliases.

<h2>Alias</h2>
Type or change the name of the alias. You can easily make two or more aliases
use the same set of Amiga fonts by separating the names by a comma, e.g.
<code>Arial,Helvetica</code>.

<h2>Add</h2>
Use this button to add a new alias. You should enter a name for the alias or else
it won't be saved.

<h2>Del</h2>
Use this button to delete the currently selected alias.

<h2>Font list</h2>
Each font set contains fonts in seven different sizes. Size 1 is the smallest,
size 7 is the largest size. Normal text is usually rendered in size 3.
<p>
Select a font size from the list, and use the
<img src=../popfont.iff alt="Ff" width=20 height=21> button to bring up a
standard font requester. You then can change the font name and size.

<h2>Set all to this font name</h2>
If you press this button, all font names are changed to the name of the
currently selected font. The sizes remain unchanged.
