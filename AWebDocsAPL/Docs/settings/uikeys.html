<h2>Changing the user defined keys</h2>
The list contains the keys (or key combinations), and actions for these keys.
<p>
Select the key you want to modify from the listview. Note that some keys or key
combinations might already be defined as commodity hotkey. Although you can
configure a command for these keys, you cannot use these keys from within AWeb
as long as that commodity is running.
<p>
The last two entries in the list define the actions to be taken on moving the
wheel of a wheel mouse.
<p>
To remove a key, just erase the command for it.

<h2>Command</h2>
In this field, you can type the <a href="../arexx/commands.html">Arexx command</a>
that should be executed when you press the key or key combination.
<p>
In the command string, you can use the following parameter specifiers:
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%u
   <td>URL currently displayed in the browser window.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%n
   <td>screen name that AWeb is running on.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%i
   <td>ID of frame that has focus.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%t
   <td>title of the document, as shown in the window title bar.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%c
   <td><a href="../startup.html">configuration name</a>.
</table>
