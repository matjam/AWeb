GUI settings: Menus</h1>

<h2>Changing menu entries</h2>
The list contains the menu definition for the browser window menus.
<p>
Select the entry you want to modify from the listview.
Use the <b>Add</b> button to add a new blank entry after the currently selected one.
Use the <b>Del</b> button to remove the selected entry.

<h2>Type</h2>
Select the type of this entry.
<table>
<tr valign=top align=left><td><b>Menu</b>
   <td>A menu entry, appearing in the menu bar.
<tr valign=top align=left><td><b>Item</b>
   <td>A menu item.
<tr valign=top align=left><td><b>Sub</b>
   <td>A menu sub-item.
      or another Sub definition.
<tr valign=top align=left><td><b>----</b>
   <td>A separator item.
</table>
<p>
Make sure the menu is correctly built. That is, items and separators can only
appear within a menu (that is, not at the top of the list), and sub-items can
only immediately follow items or other sub-items. If the menu structure is
incorrect, the <b>INVALID</b> indicator is lit.
<p>
An incorrectly built menu results in no menu at all. Should this happen, and you are
locked out because the menu to start the GUI settings is gone, just open a shell
window and type
<pre>
   AWeb3:AWebCfg GUI
</pre> to open the settings window again.

<h2>Title</h2>
Type the title as you like it to appear in the menu.

<h2>Shortcut</h2>
Type a one-character shortcut for the menu, or leave this field blank
for no shortcut.

<h2>Command</h2>
In this field, you can type the <a href="../arexx/commands.html">Arexx command</a>
that should be executed when you select the menu item.
<p>
In the command string, you can use the following parameter specifiers:
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%u
   <td>URL currently displayed in the browser window.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%n
   <td>screen name that AWeb is running on.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%i
   <td>ID of frame that has focus.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%t
   <td>title of the document, as shown in the window title bar.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top nowrap>%c
   <td><a href="../startup.html">configuration name</a>.
</table>
<p>
In addition to ARexx commands, there are a few special strings you can enter.
Some strings will result in a checkmark, others are merely a shortcut for
functionality not available in a single ARexx command. All special strings
start with the <b>@</b> character:
<p>
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@AREXX
   <td>When the item is selected, open a file requester and let the user pick an ARexx
      macro to run.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@BGIMAGES
   <td>Display a checkmark along this item reflecting if backgrounds are on or off.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@BGSOUND
   <td>Display a checkmark along this item reflecting if background sound is on or off.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@BREAKJS
   <td>Break javascript programs. This menu item is handled in a special way to work
      even when a program is running. The normal <code>JSBREAK</code> command would not
      be handled until a running program has ended by itself.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@DEBUGJS
   <td>Display a checkmark along this item reflecting if JavaScript debugging is on or off.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@DRAGGING
   <td>Display a checkmark along this item reflecting if dragging is on or off.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@LOADIMGALL<br>@LOADIMGMAPS<br>@LOADIMGOFF
   <td>Display a checkmark along this item that is mutual exclusive across these items.
      The checkmark reflects the current image loading status (all images,
      maps only, or off).
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@NOPROXY
   <td>Display a checkmark along this item reflecting the noproxy status.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>@OTHERHOT
   <td>When the item is selected, open a file requester and let the user pick a hotlist
      to display.
</table>

<h2>Rearranging menu entries</h2>
You can move an entry in the menu. Select the entry, either with the mouse or with
the cursor up and down keys. Now you can move the entry up and down
in the list with either the arrow up and arrow down buttons, or with
the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + cursor up/down keys.
