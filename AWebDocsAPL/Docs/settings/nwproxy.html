<h2>Proxy servers</h2>
A proxy server is a special server, that acts as a gateway between your
computer and the Internet. Instead of having to establish a connection
to a server possibly on the other end of the world, a browser only connects
to the proxy. The proxy server has a cache of the most popular pages, so
there is a chance the page you requested is already there. If not, the
proxy server retrieves the document for you. This will decrease the traffic
on the network, thus speeding up websurfing.
<p>
Sometimes, the proxy server is the <em>only</em> way to connect to your
provider, thereby acting as a firewall.

<h2>Configuring a proxy</h2>
First, choose the protocol you want to define the proxy for. Use the
chooser for this, it has 4 options:
<ul>
<li>HTTP
<li>FTP
<li>Gopher
<li>Telnet
</ul>

Then type in the address of the proxy in the <em>proxy</em> field. Make sure
it is in one of these two forms:
<pre><b>
   http://proxy.foo.bar
   http://proxy.foo.bar:8080
</b></pre>
where the name and port number may differ, of course.
<p>
If the address doesn't start with "<code>http://</code>",
AWeb will prepend this to the address.

<h2>Limited proxy usage</h2>
Some proxies can't handle submitting forms with <code>METHOD=POST</code>, or
<a href=../authorize.html>authorized</a> pages correctly. If you have
problems with such pages, try selecting this checkbox. It makes AWeb handle
these pages directly, without going through the proxy.

<h2><a name="passiveftp">Passive FTP</a></h2>
If you are working from behind a firewall, and you experience problems using
FTP, try selecting this checkbox. It tells AWeb to use a different way of
making the necessary FTP connections, that will more likely work from behind
a firewall.

<h2>No proxy for these sites</a></h2>
If this list contains <em>site names</em> (also known as <em>locations</em> or 
<em>host names</em>), then documents and images from these sites will never
be retrieved through the proxy.
<p>
Use the <b>Add</b> button to add a new entry, and the <b>Del</b> button to
delete the currently selected entry. Double-click on an entry to edit
the name <em>in place</em>.
<p>
You may type simple host names, or use pattern matching. If a string contains
pattern matching characters, it's matched against the full url, not only the
host name. This enables you to selectively use the proxy for files from a
server.
