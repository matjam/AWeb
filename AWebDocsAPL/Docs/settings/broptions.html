<h2><a name=htmlmode>HTML mode</a></h2>
Use this chooser to select the <a href=../htmlmode.html>HTML mode</a>.
It is recommended that you leave this set to <em>tolerant</em> unless you
encounter problems with a page.

<h2><a name=javascript>Use JavaScript</a></h2>
This chooser determines if and how AWeb will interpret <a href="../javascript.html">
JavaScript</a> in documents. It offers you the following choices:
<table>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Off
   <td>No JavaScript is interpreted.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Fastidious
   <td>Picky mode; Only JavaScript version 1.1 or lower is executed. If a run-time
      error occurs, an error requester is shown (unless you have selected not
      to <a href="#jserrors">show JavaScript errors</a>) and execution is stopped.
<tr><th align=left valign=top>Omnivorous
   <td>Execution of all JavaScript programs is attempted, even of those with versions
      that are not yet implemented in AWeb. In this mode, no run-time error requesters
      are shown, and execution will continue even after errors are encountered.<br>
      <b>WARNING</b> Because execution continues even after possibly vital JavaScript
      commands were in error, execution might go on endlessly. Use the &quot;Break
      JavaScript&quot; menu item or its shortcut (Amiga-X by default) to stop execution
      in this case.
</table>

<h2><a name=jserrors>Show JavaScript errors</a></h2>
This checkbox controls if error requesters are shown when a JavaScript
program stops in error, or not.

<h2><a name="watchjs">Warn for suspect JavaScript</a></h2>
If this option is selected, AWeb warns you for two types of suspect scripts.
<p>
A warning is given when a script runs for one minute, indicating a possible endless
loop. You now have the option to stop the script, but beware that some valid scripts
just take up that much time. If you select to continue, you will be warned again after
one minute.
<p>
A warning is also issued when during script execution the amount of free memory
drops below one quarter of the free memory amount at the time the script was
started. This might indicate that the script is allocating "many" objects and
is about to eat up all available memory. Again, you have now the option to stop
the script. Note that the cleaning up process might take a considerable amount
of time, during which AWeb seems to hang, but is in fact returning the allocated
memory to the system. If you decide to continue after this warning, you'll be
warned again if the amount of free memory drops below one quarter of the free
memory at the time of the latest warning.

<h2><a name=nobanners>Suppress banner windows</a></h2>
Many pages on the net automatically open a banner or advertisement window
as soon as they are loaded. Select this checkbox to get rid of those windows.
<p>
See <a href="../javascript.html#nobanners">here</a> for an explanation what
this option exactly does.

<h2><a name=tooltips>Display tooltips for images</a></h2>
If this checkbox is selected, a small tooltip window will pop up when you keep
the mouse still over an image that has an alternate text associated with it.

<h2><a name=handpointer>Hand pointer over links</a></h2>
If this checkbox is selected, a different pointer image is used when the mouse
pointer is over a hyperlink. By default a hand image is used, but you can
<a href="../pointers.html">change</a> this.

<h2><a name=underline>Underlined links</a></h2>
The checkbox determines whether links should be displayed underlined or not. If
underlined is selected, <em>new links</em> are underlined with a
solid line, and <em>visited links</em> will have a dashed line.
<p>
If this checkbox is selected, images that are links have a border in the
appropriate colour.

<h2><a name=frames>Use frames</a></h2>
This checkbox determines if AWeb will use and display frames.

<h2><a name=nominal>Nominal frame height</a></h2>
On small windows (like those on 200 or 256 high screens), a framed page
often appears squeezed. If you check this checkbox, a larger height is
used to layout the framed page against if the window has a small height.
This will make the individual frames larger and easier to use.

<h2><a name=inctable>Incremental table display</a></h2>
When reading a page that contain a large table, most browsers don't display
anything until the entire table is read in, which can last quite long.
AWeb supports <em>incremental table display</em>, that means that the table
is displayed while it is read in. The advantage is clear: you see more of
the page in an earlier stage of loading.<br>
There are however two drawbacks. First, a later section of the table may
enforce different column widths, resulting in a redisplay of the entire
table. In the worst case, this means that the table is redisplayed with
every block of data read, causing an ugly flicker. Second, incremental
table display may be about 10% slower than normal display, but probably
this is more than compensated for by the earlier display.
<p>
With this checkbox you can switch between incremental and non-incremental
table display.

<h2><a name=background>Use background and colours</a></h2>
Many pages contain background images or background colours. AWeb will
display these only if this checkbox is checked. If it is unchecked, AWeb
will use only the colours defined in the <a href=brcolours.html>Browser
colours</a> settings page.

<h2><a name=bgsound>Use background sound</a></h2>
Some pages have a background sound attached. If this checkbox is selected,
the sound plays every time you display the page. If it is unselected, the
sound will not be played automatically. You can hear the sound only after
selecting the <code>Control / Play&nbsp;background&nbsp;sound</code> menu item.

<h2><a name=blink>Blink rate</a></h2>
This field determines the rate at which blinking text blinks. The number
is the number of tenths of a second that each blinking phase (on or off)
lasts. When you set this number to zero, blinking is disabled.
