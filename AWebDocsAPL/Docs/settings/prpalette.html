<h1><img src=../aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93>&nbsp; Program settings: Palette</h1>

On this settings page, you can change the
colour settings for the AWeb own public screen, pretty much like the
Workbench Palette preferences program does for the Workbench screen.
<p>
The gadgets on this settings page are only enabled if AWeb runs on its
<a href=prscreen.html>own screen</a>. When using another screen, you
should use the colour settings method provided by the owner of that screen.
<p>
The palette settings are only effective when AWeb opens its
<a href=prscreen.html>own screen</a>. When using another screen,
it respects the settings for that screen.
<p>
This settings page has two major parts.

<h2>Pen settings</h2>
The list, and the upper palette button row, specify the screen pen settings,
comparable to the right-hand part of the Workbench Palette program. To change
a pen, first select the pen from the list, then select the color from the
palette.

<h2>Change palette</h2>
The lower palette button row allows you to change the actual color of the
pens. This is comparable to the left-hand part of the Workbench Palette
program. Press the <b>Change colour</b> button to pop up a colour
requester for the selected colour from the palette.
