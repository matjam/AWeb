<h1><img src=aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93 >&nbsp; Using your own GUI buttons</h1>

<h2>Configurable buttons</h2>
The buttons in AWeb's main window are fully user-configurable. They are
read from the file <code>Images/def_buttons</code>. This must be a
picture file, but the exact format isn't relevant as long as you have a
datatype installed that can read the file.
<p>
The icon that goes with the file is important. The tooltypes in the icon
contain vital information, without this information AWeb cannot use the
file.
<p>
You can also use your own <a href=animation.html>transfer animation</a>
shown in the <em>background status</em> gadget.

<h2>Installing your own buttons</h2>
The <code>Storage/Buttons</code> drawer contains a few alternate sets, and
it is a good place to store new button sets.
<p>
To install new button images, open AWeb's drawer
on your Workbench. Now you can double-click the <em>Install_Buttons</em>
icon. It will open a file requester from which you can pick your button set.
The install procedure will then copy the selected set to your <code>Images</code>
drawer.
<p>
Alternatively, you can click the <em>Install_Buttons</em> icon once, hold
the shift key and double-click on the icon of the button set you want to
install.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You cannot install new buttons while AWeb is running.

<h2>Creating your own button file</h2>
Use an ordinary paint program to design your buttons. Create one
picture that contains all button imagery. Make sure all button images are
equal in size. If you want different <em>selected</em> imagery
(shown when the button is depressed), draw those images too. Save the
picture in the <code>Storage/Buttons</code> drawer. Save it with icon,
or add an icon later.
<p>
It is a good idea to keep the picture file as small as possible.
The larger the file is, the longer it will take to load at startup
time of AWeb.

<p>
Then add some tooltypes to the icon. The tooltypes
tell AWeb where in your picture to look for which button image. Use the
following tooltypes:
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>BUTTON_SIZE=<i>width,height</i>
   <td>This defines the width and height of each image, in pixels.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>
      BACK=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      FORWARD=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      HOME=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      ADDHOTLIST=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      HOTLIST=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      CANCEL=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      NETSTATUS=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      SEARCH=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      RELOAD=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      LOADIMAGES=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i>
   <td>These tooltypes define the location of the button imagery in
      the picture, for each button.<br>
      <i>nx,ny</i> are the x and y positions of the top left corner
      of the <em>normal</em> image.<br>
      <i>sx,sy</i> are optional. If present, they tell the location of
      the <em>selected</em> image for this button.<br>
      If a button definition is missing from the tooltypes, the built-in
      default image is used for that button.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>SECBUTTON_SIZE=<i>width,height</i>
   <td>This defines the width and height of secure link indicator image, in pixels.
      Default is the same width and height as the other buttons.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>
      SECURE=<i>nx,ny</i><br>
      UNSECURE=<i>nx,ny</i>
   <td>These two tooltypes define the location of images for the <em>secure</em>
      and <em>unsecure</em> status of the secure link indicator.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>NSBUTTON_SIZE=<i>width,height</i>
   <td>This defines the width and height of each network status button image, in pixels.
      Default is the same width and height as the other buttons.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>
      NSCANCEL=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i><br>
      NSCANCELALL=<i>nx,ny,sx,sy</i>
   <td>These two tooltypes define the location of images for the <em>cancel</em> and
      <em>cancel all</em> buttons in the <a href=nws.html>network status
      window</a>.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>TRANSPARENT
   <td>If this tooltype is present, and the picture was saved as a transparent
      brush, the images will be rendered with a transparent background.
      Note that this only works if the datatype supports transparency. Most
      regular datatypes do, one important exception is the ILBM datatype
      that comes with the V43 picture datatype.
