<h1><img src=aweb.iff width=192 height=93 alt=(logo)>&nbsp; Introduction</h1>
AWeb is a fast and powerful World Wide Web browser for the Amiga computer.
<p>
Some of the most important features of AWeb-II are listed below.

<h2>HTML and browsing</h2>
AWeb offers complete <a HREF="html.html">HTML support</a>, including:
<ul>
<li>JavaScript 1.1.
<li>Frames.
<li>Tables, including table backgrounds.
<li>Font sizes, faces, colours, subscript, superscript, optional blinking.
<li>Client-side image maps, also when the map is defined in another document.
<li>Embedded objects and background sounds.
</ul>
<p>
As a unique feature, AWeb offers three different
<a HREF="htmlmode.html">HTML modes</a> ensure the
correct display of virtually every page:
<ul>
<li>Strict mode, where only the official standard is recognized.
<li>Tolerant mode, which also recognizes many of the NetScape and other
   extensions. Tolerant mode also offers automatic recovery from many
   syntactic errors, including bad comments.
<li>Compatible mode, to recover from really bad HTML, where automatic
   recovery would break most other pages.
</ul>
<p>
<a href="browser.html#images">Images</a> are shown using datatypes.
That means you are not stuck with
a particular decoding method built-in in the browser, but you can choose the
datatype that does the job the best. Instead of the datatype you can use
special plugins (included) that supports progressive decoding for GIF, JPEG
and PNG images, and animated GIF.<br>
Using datatypes also ensures the widest possible coverage of image formats,
where other browsers only support a limited number of built-in formats.
<p>
<a href="browser.html#stimages">"Standalone" images</a> (that are shown
when following a hyperlink) are
shown in the browser window, or optionally using an external image
viewer.
<p>
You can <a HREF="settings/brviewers.html">define</a> which action to
perform for all types of files, depending
on their MIME type. Streaming input for external programs is supported.
For textual files, AWeb checks if the file really contains text before
attempting to show the contents, in order to avoid problems with servers
that don't recognize extensions like <code>.lha</code>.
<p>
A public <a HREF="api.html">plugin interface</a> allows seamless integration
of extension programs within AWeb.

<h2>Networking </h2>
AWeb can use a wide range of TCP-stacks: AmiTCP/IP, I-Net225, AS-225
or compatible, like Miami or TermiteTCP. The TCP stack can be
<a HREF="starttcp.html">started
automatically</a>  when it is needed to fetch a document from the net.
Without a TCP stack running, you can still view local files.
<p>
Using internal multitasking, AWeb offers totally asynchronous and
parallel network access. Up to 256  parallel connections are supported,
but you can configure a lower maximum.
<p>
The HTTP, FTP, Mailto, News and Gopher protocols are supported internally.
Telnet  is supported by an external program or an ARexx plugin. Optionally
you can use an external program for Mailto or News, too.
<p>
AWeb supports both the client pull (the "<code>Refresh:</code>" HTTP header)
and server push (multipart/x-mixed-replace) mechanisms.
<p>
AWeb supports the use of <a HREF="settings/nwproxy.html">proxies</a> for
HTTP, FTP, Gopher and Telnet.
You can define sites or URL patterns for which the proxy should not
be used.
<p>
A persistent, disk based <a HREF="cache.html">cache</a> ensures fast access
to pages that you have visited before.
In order to keep the cached pages up to date, AWeb can
verify the cached files once per session or with every access. You can
also turn cache verification off to decrease the network usage. AWeb
allows you to define sites or URL patterns for files that should never
be cached.
<p>
HTTP <a HREF="authorize.html">authorization</a> and proxy authorization are
supported. A separate window allows for easy maintenance of your userid and
passwords.
<p>
NetScape and RFC 2109 <a HREF="cookies.html">cookies</a> are fully supported.
AWeb helps you protect
your privacy in several ways: it can show an alert requester whenever
a site wants to set a cookie, and you can specify sites from which cookies
must never be accepted . You can tag individual cookies as being trusted
so the alert requester will not be shown again for those cookies. Cookies
are stored in a readable and editable ASCII file.
<p>
AWeb supports <a HREF="secure.html">secure connections</a> by use of
MiamiSSL. 
<p>
AWeb lets you load all images, or delay all image loading. A third option
is to load only clickable maps, so you know where to click on.

<h2>Productivity</h2>
AWeb has many features to enhance your productivity when browsing. Most
of these features are not found in other Amiga browsers, and some of them
not even in browsers on other platforms.
<p>
AWeb is fast. It has a unique <a HREF="settings/nwcache.html"><em>fast
cache response</em></a> mode that
shows cached pages immediately without delay, and yet ensures that
you always see the most recent version of a page.
<p>
You can <a HREF="settings/broptions.html#nobanners">suppress</a> those
annoying advertizement windows popping up on many sites. 
<p>
The <a href="browser.html#clipboard">clipboard</a> is supported. You can
not only copy or paste URLs,
but you can also drag-select in a page and copy the selected text
to the clipboard. 
<p>
The <a HREF="search.html">search function</a> lets you locate text in
the page. The text found will
be highlighted so you can easily recognize it.
<p>
You can <a href="browser.html#scroll">scroll</a> pages with the keyboard.
This is also possible for
pages shown in <a href="browser.html#frames">frames</a>, and even when the
frame has no scroller.
<p>
You can <a HREF="print.html">print</a>  the page graphically, or
save it as IFF file  and process or print it later.<br>
Instead of a graphical printout, you can also print a page textually using the
HTTX conversion utility that is included in the AWeb-II package.
You can save the document as text (using HTTX) or as HTML source.
Functions that use the HTTX utility are installed automatically as
an option.
<p>
AWeb was the first browser to feature a <a HREF="nws.html">network status
window</a>, that enables
you to watch all foreground and background network transfer progresses.
You can cancel selected transfers, or all transfers at once. A global
CPS rate is also shown in this window.
<p>
You can store your favourite links in a <a HREF="hotlist.html">hotlist</a>. 
A powerful <a HREF="hotlistmgr.html">hotlist
manager</a> allows very easy maintenance of your hotlist. You can add,
delete and sort entries, and group them in a hierarchical way. You can
include an entry in more than one group simultaneously without having
to duplicate it first. A set of search functions, including pattern matching,
helps you in finding back any entry in your hotlist.
<p>
The <a HREF="cachebrowser.html">cache browser</a>   allows you to view or
save any file from the cache.
You can delete single or multiple files. A set of search functions,
including pattern matching, lets you easily find back that interesting
document or image you like to view again.
<p>
The <a HREF="autosearch.html">autosearch</a>   feature allows you
to use your favourite search engine directly from the URL entry field.
<p>
You can <a HREF="browser.html#iconify">iconify</a> AWeb, closing its screen
and windows but let transfers continue in the background.
<p>
AWeb features a powerful set of <a HREF="arexx/arexx.html">ARexx commands</a> ,
that allows you to control
almost every aspect of AWeb from outside, including all settings.
Combined with the unique ability to <a HREF="shellcmd.html">start ARexx macros</a>
from a hyperlink
or form button, this makes it possible to build complex applications that
use AWeb as their user interface!

<h2>Configurability</h2>
AWebs configuration items are grouped in four separate
<a HREF="settings/settings.html">settings windows</a>.
These allow you to tailor almost every aspect of AWebs operation to
your personal preferences.
<p>
You can <a HREF="settings/prscreen.html"><em>easily</em> configure</a>
AWeb to open its windows on its own
public screen, a named public screen or the default public screen. The
network status, hotlist viewer and history windows are optionally
opened automatically at the program start.
<p>
You can completely <a HREF="settings/uimenu.html">configure</a> the menus
 to fit your personal needs. You can rearrange the menus, or add your
own items that execute ARexx commands or run ARexx macros.
<p>
You can <a HREF="settings/uinavs.html">configure</a> the function of
the ten navigation buttons at the top of the browser window. 
<p>
You can change the default <a href="popup.html">popup menu</a> that is
shown for images, links
or frames. Using ARexx commands, you can <a HREF="settings/uipopup.html">add</a>
all functionality that you
find useful. You can even start ARexx macros  or external programs
from the popup menus.
<p>
Where other browsers have fastlink buttons, AWeb offers you the much
more powerful <a HREF="gui.html#user"><em>user buttons</em></a>. You can
<a HREF="settings/uibuttons.html">assign</a> any ARexx command
to these buttons. This includes opening a URL (which would turn the
button into a simple fastlink button), changing a single configuration
item (like HTML mode), and starting ARexx macros  or external programs.
<p>
You can assign your own functions to most <a HREF="settings/uikeys.html">
keys of the keyboard</a>. 

<h2>Web authoring </h2>
You can easily edit the HTML source of files stored locally on your hard
disk directly from within AWeb.
<p>
For authors of JavaScript programs, AWeb contains a unique built-in
<a HREF="jsprogrammer.html#debugger">JavaScript debugger</a>. The standalone
<a HREF="jsprogrammer.html#awebjs">AWebJS</a> program allows you to run
scripts outside of the browser.
