<h1><img src=aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93>&nbsp; About MIME types</h1>

MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is a mechanism for specifying
and describing the format of Internet message bodies. It was primarily
designed for e-mail, but MIME types are used also to identify the type of
data in the HTTP protocol, the most widely used protocol on the World Wide
Web.
<p>
For a browser like AWeb, the MIME type of a document determines whether
the file should be displayed in the browser window, or be processed by
some other program.
<p>
A MIME type consists of a <em>type</em> and a <em>subtype</em>. The
<em>type</em> describes the major class of data, like text or image. The
<em>subtype</em> is used for a subdivision of the major type into different
formats, like GIF or JPEG images.
<p>
According to RFC 1521, the following official MIME types are defined:
<dl>
<dt><b>TEXT/HTML</b>
<dd>This is a document in the HTML hypertext format. Virtually all pages
on the Web are in this format.
<p>
<dt><b>TEXT/PLAIN</b>
<dd>This type is used for plain text documents (normally in ASCII).
<p>
<dt><b>APPLICATION/OCTET-STREAM</b>
<dd>This describes a binary file. The file could be processed by some
application. An example of this would be an LHA archive.
<p>
<dt><b>APPLICATION/POSTSCRIPT</b>
<dd>The document is in PostScript format.
<p>
<dt><b>IMAGE/GIF</b>
<dt><b>IMAGE/JPEG</b>
<dd>These are images, in GIF and JPEG format.
<p>
<dt><b>AUDIO/BASIC</b>
<dd>This type is used for audio data encoded using 8-bit ISDN mu-law [PCM].
<p>
<dt><b>VIDEO/MPEG</b>
<dd>This is an animation in MPEG format.
</dl>
In addition to these official types and subtypes, it is allowed to define
extension MIME types and subtypes. These should start with <b>X-</b> to
avoid collisions with future official MIME types.
