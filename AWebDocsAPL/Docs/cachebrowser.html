<h1><img src=aweb.iff width=192 height=93 alt=(logo)>&nbsp; Cachebrowser</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
With the <em>cachebrowser</em>, you can check which files are (still) in the
<a href=cache.html>cache</a>. You have options to view the cached objects,
save them to another file, or delete them from the cache.

<h2>Opening the window</h2>
Select <code>Cache / Cachebrowser...</code> from the menu to open the
cachebrowser window.
If the cachebrowser window is already open, it will pop up to front, and
will be activated.

<h2>The cache list</h2>
The list shows all cached objects. The following information is shown for each
object:
<p>
<strong>URL</strong>: the Url (address) of this object.<br>
<strong>Date</strong>: the date when it was retrieved.<br>
<strong>Size</strong>: the size of the object in bytes.<br>
<strong>Type</strong>: the <a href=mime.html>MIME type</a> of the object.<br>
<strong>File</strong>: the file name of the object in the cache directory.

<h2>General information</h2>
Below the list there is a fuelgauge showing how full the cache is, compared
to the configured cache size.
<p>
Also the number of files and the total occupied disk space is shown.

<h2><a name=find>Find</a></h2>
Enable the find function. This button toggles, clicking it again
(or clicking the <a href=#match>match</a> button) disables the find function.
<p>
You can now type a search string in the entry field.
After you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the entry field, or click the <b>Next</b>
button, the string is located in the list. Clicking the
<b>Next</b> button again finds the next occurrence.

<h3><a name=match>Match</a></h3>
Enable the match function. This button toggles, clicking it again
(or clicking the <a href=#find>find</a> button) disables the match function.
<p>
You can now type a search string or pattern in the entry field.
After you hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> in the entry field, all entries in the
list matching the string or pattern become selected.
<p>
The match function supports both plain search strings and patterns.
If the search string typed contains a DOS pattern matching character,
it uses pattern matching against the full URLs.
Otherwise a search is made for any occurrence of the search string
within the URLs.
<p>
When the pattern does not
contain the addressing scheme part (the part like "http://"), then the
scheme part of every URL is ignored. So a pattern "foo.bar#?" matches URLs
"http://foo.bar/xyz.html" and "ftp://foo.bar/zoo".

<h2>Sort by</h2>
Use the <b>Sort by</b> chooser to sort the entries in the list by their URL,
their date (most recent will be shown first), or by their MIME type.

<h2>Open an object</h2>
If you have selected an object from the list, you can use the <b>Open</b> button
to load the page in the current browser window. If it is an image, the external
viewer for that image (as configured in the <a href=settings/brviewers.html>viewers
settings</a>) will be started.
<p>
Instead of the <b>Open</b> button, you can double click on the entry, or use the
<kbd>Enter</kbd> key.

<h2>Save an object</h2>
If you have selected an object from the list, you can use the <b>Save</b> button
to save the object to another file. You will see a save requester where you can
enter the file name.

<h2>Delete objects</h2>
If you have selected one or more objects from the list, you can use the <b>Delete</b> button
to delete the objects from the cache.
