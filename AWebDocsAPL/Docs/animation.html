<h1><img src=aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93 >&nbsp; Using your own transfer animation</h1>

<h2>Configurable animation</h2>
The transfer animation in AWeb's main window is fully user-configurable. It is
read from the file <code>Images/def_transferanim</code>. This must be a
picture file, but the exact format isn't relevant as long as you have a
datatype installed that can read the file.
<p>
The icon that goes with the file is important. The tooltypes in the icon
contain vital information, without this information AWeb cannot use the
file.
<p>
The animation is shown in the <em>background status</em> gadget. this gadget
will be sized according to the size of the animation. For the best look, you
should use an animation that is about twice as high as your
<a href=buttons.html>button images</a>.

<h2>Installing your own animation</h2>
The <code>Storage/Animations</code> drawer contains a few alternate animations, and
it is a good place to store new animations.
<p>
To install a new animation, open AWeb's drawer
on your Workbench. Now you can double-click the <em>Install_Animation</em>
icon. It will open a file requester from which you can pick your animation.
The install procedure will then copy the selected file to your <code>Images</code>
drawer.
<p>
Alternatively, you can click the <em>Install_Animation</em> icon once, hold
the shift key and double-click on the icon of the animation you want to
install.
<p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You cannot install a new animation while AWeb is running.

<h2>Creating your own animation file</h2>
Use an ordinary paint program to design your animation. Create one
picture that contains all animation frames. Make sure all button images are
equal in size. Also every next frame must be at the same horizontal and/or vertical
distance from the previous. Save the
picture in the <code>Storage/Animations</code> drawer. Save it with icon,
or add an icon later.
<p>
It is a good idea to keep the picture file as small as possible.
The larger the file is, the longer it will take to load at startup
time of AWeb.

<p>
Then add some tooltypes to the icon. The tooltypes
tell AWeb where in your picture to look for the animation frames. Use the
following tooltypes:
<table>
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>SIZE=<i>width,height</i>
   <td>This defines the width and height of each animation frame, in pixels.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>FIRST=<i>left,top</i>
   <td>Defines the top left corner of the first animation frame.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>FRAMES=<i>number</i>
   <td>This is the total number of frames in the animation. After the last frame
      the first one is used again.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>DELTA=<i>delta_x,delta_y</i>
   <td>This is the amount to add to the current x and y coordinates to get
      to the next frame.
<tr valign=top>
   <th align=left valign=top>REST=<i>left,top</i>
   <td>Defines the top left corner of the <em>rest</em> image, that is displayed
      if no transfer is going on.<br>
      This tooltype is optional. If you don't specify it, the animation gadget
      will be empty at rest.
