<h2>Purpose</h2>
Some sites ask you to supply personal or secret information, like your
credit card number to pay for some service or goods you order. When you 
supply this information and click the send button, this information is sent
over the internet. You will want to be sure of two things:
<ol>
<li>That the company asking you for this sensitive information, really
    <strong>is</strong> the company they claim to be, and
<li>That no-one is eavesdropping at one of the many intermediate computers
    that the message passes through, and reads your private information.
</ol>

Secure connections through SSL offer a way to achieve both security goals. It
uses <em>encryption</em> so that no-one can read your data except the one
you are sending it to. It uses <em>certificates</em> to ensure that no-one
can forge their identity and claim to be someone else.
<p>
You might want to read more about
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/security/ssl/howitworks.html">
how SSL works</a>.
<p>
Secure connections can only ensure that your information isn't seen by
others. It can't in any way prevent that the legitimate receiver of your
data won't abuse it.

<h2>SSL libraries</h2>
Before you can use secure connections, you have to install a library
that implements the secure socket layer (SSL).
<p>
AWeb supports the freely available
<a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~TheAntony/AmiSSL/">AmiSSL</a> library by Andrija Antonijevic.
<p>
AWeb also supports MiamiSSL, available
for registered users of the <a href="http://www.nordicglobal.com/Miami.html">
Miami</a> TCP stack by Holger Kruse. If you have both libraries installed,
AWeb will use AmiSSL. In case you want AWeb to use MiamiSSL, you should
remove or rename <code>LIBS:amissl.library</code> <i>before</i> you start AWeb.
<p>
The <a href="infowindow.html">information window</a> will tell you which
SSL library was used.

<h2>Be sure of the sender's identity</h2>
Next to the status bar field at the top of the browser window, is a small
indicator. It tells you if the current document was retrieved over a secure
connection. If it is, that means that the sender of the document is really
the one they claim to be, and the page wasn't forged by an impersonator.
<p>
By default, this indicator is blank for a normal document,
and a small image of a lock for a secure document, but you can
<a href="buttons.html">change</a> the images used.
<p>
If a document uses frames, the image reflects the security status of the
frame that has focus. Simply click in the frame to see if it is secure.

<h2>Encryption details</h2>
The cipher method that was used in the connection is shown in
the <a href="infowindow.html">information window</a>.
<p>
Because encryption requires a lot of calculation, retrieving data over a
secure connection may be substantially slower than when the same information
is retrieved over a normal connection. This speed loss will depend on the
cipher method used. You may want to disable some cipher methods for your
SSL library in order to make secure connections work faster (but possibly
slightly less secure!).

<h2>Protect your form data</h2>
Even if a document was retrieved over a secure connection, that doesn't
guarantee that form data will be sent away over a secure connection too.
Therefore AWeb is able to warn you when you are about to send data with a
form in an unsecure way, and give you an opportunity to cancel it. You can
enable this by selecting the <a href="settings/nwprivacy.html#formwarn">Warn
before sending unsecure form data</a> option.
